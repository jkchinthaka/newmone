# Full-Stack E2E Known Limitations

**Status:** SOURCE_VALIDATED

1. Local Docker engine may be unavailable — runtime then **BLOCKED**; CI provides runtime.
2. Some WO/inventory UI steps are exercised via BFF API through Nginx (still production path) when UI selectors are unstable.
3. CI latency thresholds are disposable-environment smoke only — not capacity claims.
4. File upload coverage depends on storage mode and may assert controlled rejection only.
5. Redis/MinIO hard-failure chaos tests remain optional and CI-only.
6. Live production login is **not** validated by this suite.
7. Auth refresh-expiry edge cases may require deterministic clock control (follow-up).
